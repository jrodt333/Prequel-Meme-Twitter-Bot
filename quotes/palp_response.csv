DEWIT!
I am the Senate.
"Good, goooooood…"
Are you threatening me master Jedi?
"No, no, no, you will die!"
I'm too weak! Oh don't kill me please!
UNLIMITED POWER!
"Soon I will have a new apprentice, one far younger and more powerful."
I will make it legal.
The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed.
